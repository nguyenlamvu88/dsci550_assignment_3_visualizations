# Bigfoot Sightings Visualizations

## Project Overview

This repository is dedicated to the exploration and visualization of Bigfoot sightings across the United States. Utilizing a variety of data visualization techniques, this project aims to uncover patterns and insights into the mysterious phenomenon of Bigfoot sightings. From heatmaps to word clouds, each file within this repository contributes to a comprehensive analysis of sighting reports, terrain features, witness accounts, and even the correlation of sightings with lunar phases.

### Visualizations 

Below is a detailed overview of each visualization provided in this repository, including descriptions and direct links to view them online.
